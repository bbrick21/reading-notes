# Expressions and Operators

**Assignment Operators** assign values to variables. The right operand is the value assigned to the value on the left. `X = y` assigns the value of y, to x. 

There are math operators as well. FOr example, the addition operator `+= f` would make x = x + f.
Both subtraction and multiplication follow the same format, instead using `-` or `*`.

**Comparison operators** compare values and return boolean values (true/false). For example, if x = 7, and y = 7, you could compare the two using ==. So the input x == y would return `true`. 

The operand `!=` checks to see if values are not equal, thus x != y would return as `false`, as the two values are the same.

**Loops** 

Loops are used to do something repeatedly. Loops, put simply, repeat an action some number of times. There are different loop statements that determine how many times to do something.

**For Statements** will repeat a loop until a specified condition is `false`. 

**Do while** loops repeat until a specified condition is false. A statement might look like 
> `do
    statement
while (condition)`
In this case, the statement will execute once each time before the condition is checked.
