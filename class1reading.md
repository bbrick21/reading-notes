# Summary of learnings about markdown

## Headings:
* Headings are the most basic function of what I have read about. Headings come in six different sizes, and correspond to the number of # symbols that are placed at the beginning of the line (a single # means heading 1, the largest. Six # symbols mean heading 6, the smallest heading). When creating headings, it is important to make sure there is a space in between the # symbol and the text.

## Make text look cool
* If you want to make your text more appealing, there are ways you can style text. 
  * **This text is bold. Bold text is created by starting and ending a sentence with ** .** 
* You can also *italicize* text. This is done by starting and ending a sentence with *. 
* If you ever type something you ~~want~~ don't want, you can strikethrough text by enclosing text with ~~ .
* It looks like you can also make text both bold *and* italicized by using three asterisks to enclose text. It will look ***like this***.

## Lists
1. By numbering lines, you can create lists of text
2. This would be helpful for listing steps
3. Even if you don't list the numbers in order, they will show up in numberical order.
> You can also place a blockquote underneath an item to call more attention to it
>> This is done by placing the ">" character at the start of the line, or >> for the second line.
4. Then your list can continue

## Escaping Characters
* Starting a line with an asterisk will create a bullet like this
\* But if I  start this line with a backslash I can use the character as normal 

## Other things
* You can also quote code itself by enclosing it with backticks: ` 
* This way, the code inside the lines `**will be denoted as code**` - as this would be bold text without the format
* You can also link to other websites by using this format: `(Name you want to show up)[URL of website}`
* If I enter `[Code Fellows Course Calendar](https://www.codefellows.org/course-calendar/)`, the output will be:
> [Code Fellows Course Calendar](https://www.codefellows.org/course-calendar/)

## Tasks
* If you are trying to display a to-do list, you can start each line with `[ ]`
- [ ] This is an unchecked box. It is empty between the brackets
- [x] This is a checked box. There is an X between the brackets.
