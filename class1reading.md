# Summary of learnings about markdown

## Headings:
* Headings are the most basic function of what I have read about. Headings come in six different sizes, and correspond to the number of # symbols that are placed at the beginning of the line (a single # means heading 1, the largest. Six # symbols mean heading 6, the smallest heading). When creating headings, it is important to make sure there is a space in between the # symbol and the text.

## Make text look cool
* If you want to make your text more appealing, there are ways you can style text. 
  * **This text is bold. Bold text is created by starting and ending a sentence with ** .** 
* You can also *italicize* text. This is done by starting and ending a sentence with *. 
* If you ever type something you ~~want~~ don't want, you can strikethrough text by enclosing text with ~~ .
* It looks like you can also make text both bold *and* italicized by using three asterisks to enclose text. It will look ***like this***.

## Lists
1. By numbering lines, you can create lists of text
2. This would be helpful for listing steps
 1. It appears that you can also indent a bullet point by clicking tab in front of it
