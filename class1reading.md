# Summary of learnings about markdown

## Headings:
* Headings are the most basic function of what I have read about. Headings come in six different sizes, and correspond to the number of # symbols that are placed at the beginning of the line (a single # means heading 1, the largest. Six # symbols mean heading 6, the smallest heading). When creating headings, it is important to make sure there is a space in between the # symbol and the text.

## Make text look cool
* If you want to make your text more appealing, there are ways you can style text. 
  * **This text is bold. Bold text is created by starting and ending a sentence with ** .** 
* You can also *italicize* text. This is done by starting and ending a sentence with *. 
* If you ever type something you ~~want~~ don't want, you can strikethrough text by enclosing text with ~~ .
* It looks like you can also make text both bold *and* italicized by using three asterisks to enclose text. It will look ***like this***.

## Lists
1. By numbering lines, you can create lists of text
2. This would be helpful for listing steps
3. Even if you don't list the numbers in order, they will show up in numberical order.
  1. If you want to indent part of a list, click tab twice before the line
  2. This way you can create substeps
4. This is neat
