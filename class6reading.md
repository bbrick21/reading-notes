# JavaScript
JavaScript is a functional programming language that is best known for web page scripting. JavaScript supports object-oriented, imperative, and declarative styles. JavaScript is also used in non-browser environments such as Node.js and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript can be used to build browser APIs or to build libraries to be applied to HTML.

**Note**: JavaScript should not be confused with Java, which is a different programming language.

* **Variables** - Variables are containers for storing data within JavaScript. To use a variable, you must declare it. To declare a variable, you  can use `let`. For example, `let Variable1` declares "Variable1" as a variable. 

Next, you might give a variable a value. For example `Variable1 = 'Bryce';`, which assigns the value "Bryce" to Variable1. You can declare a variable and give it a value on the same line. `let Variable1 = 'Bryce';`. You can also declare multiple variables in one statement by separating each variable with a comma. 

Once a variable is declared you can retrieve it by calling the variable name. `Variable1` 

**Note**: Variables are case sensitive. 

Variables can hold values of different types: 

* String - Sequence of text. Should have quotes around it: `'Bryce';`
* Number - Number, does not have quotes around it in code: `14;`. 
* Boolean - True/false value: `true;`
* Array - Store multiple values in a single reference. `[1, 'Bryce]`
* Object - Everything in JavaScript is an object, this can be anything. 

* **Operator**: The equals sign `=` is an assignment operator. It assigns a value to an identifier. `x = 90` would assign the number 90 to the identifier x. 

Double equals sign `==` is an actual "equal to" operator. x == 5 + 7 assigns a value of 12 to x.
