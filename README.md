# What is "Growth Mindset"?
* I like to think that Growth Mindset is the idea that *any skill* one can identify, one can learn.
* We begin learning things from the moment we are born. As we age, the concepts we learn may become more complex, but can be learn so long as effort is applied.

## How can I exercise Growth Mindset? 
1. Understand the cycle of learning:
> 1. Unconscious incompetence: I don't know how to do something, because I am unaware it exists.
> 2. Concsious incompetence: I don't know how to do something, but I am aware that I lack this skill. 
> 3. Conscious competence: I have spent enough time studying this that I can do it when I really focus on it.
> 4. Unconscious competence: I have done this skill so much that I can do it without thinking much about it. 

A good way to think about this cycle is riding a bike. When you are born, you did not know how to ride a bike, but at one point invested the time to learn. 

2. Remind yourself that no matter how difficult a skill might be to learn, it can be learned. Any person who has been successful in anything was not born knowing how to do it. FOr example, Lionel Messi was probably totally unaware of the game of soccer for the first year or two of his life.
