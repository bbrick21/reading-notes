# Summary of learnings about using a terminal

## What is a terminal? 
A terminal is an interface to your computer that is controlled via text, rather than a point and click experience like your Graphical User Interface (Windows or MacOS). 

## How it works
* When you first open a terminal, you are presented with a prompt. Generally, you will follow a prompt with 2 things: a command and a command line argument. 
* After entering both a command and a command line argument on line 1, the next few lines are usually output from running the command. Some commands do not display any text, instead just running their commands and only displaying text upon error. 
* After the terminal has run a command and is ready for you to run another command, a prompt will be presented beneath the output from the previous command. 
* Within each terminal is a **shell**. The shell is the program where text is output from the terminal. One common shell is Bash.
